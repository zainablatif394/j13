		<li style="color:blue"><b>Blue:</b><br>Blue is associated with the sea and sky and calmness, and often suggests trust and serenity. Some shades (e.g., ice blue) reflect purity and coolness and are ideal for products like bottled water and toothpast (Oral-B). Brands like<b> Walls use dark blue to signify quality, while brands like Bombay Sapphire have used the colour to forge a distinctive brand identity as well as to reflect their unique blend of ingredients.</b></li><br>

	    <li style="color:red"><b>Red:</b><br>Red has the hue with the strongest stimulation, giving it the power to excite with increased pulse and heart rate and raised blood pressure. Women in red are rated more sexy than when wearing any other colour, while men in red are rated as more powerful, and it’s not just a coincidence that drivers of red cars are more likely to be involved in car accidents.

	    <li style="color:green"><b>Green:</b>Green symbolizes ideas of refreshment and nature and is connected to ideas of healthiness. However, green is a delicate colour and can have strong negative connotations, as it is also the colour of decay and putrefaction. Although BP has tried to hijack green to symbolize their<b> environmental </b>credentials, they haven’t always lived up to these ideals. Holiday Inn and Starbucks make good use of green.</li><br>
	    <li>White is often a sign of purity, cleanness and coolness. It is a basic colour, bringing out everything else. For service brands, white is used everywhere the customer expects cleanliness <b>(kitchens, surgeries, etc)</b>. The Innocent brand of fruit smoothies, use the purity of white to great effect.</li>
