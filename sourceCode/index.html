                    <div id="Introduce">
                I am in my six semester of senior year in SOSTWARE ENGINEER at VIRTUAL University. In this memo, I am going to tell you little bit about my habbits, interests,and my future goals.<br>
                My personality consists of different characteristic traits and habits which help me make a decent human being. Certain aspects of my personality are good while there are other negative sides as well.<br>
                I make sure I have the basic good habits which include respecting my elders, greeting people when I meet them, wishing them well when departing etc. Other than this, observing the law, serving the poor and downtrodden, helping the sick and needy, giving shelter to the homeless, assisting someone with a handicap, etc. are also other good habits of mine. To lead on a peaceful life, I develop other good habits like reading, writing, listening to music, dancing, singing etc. Going to the temple and offering prayers, giving alms to the poor, supporting the old etc. are other such habits which fulfill the needs of my soul.

            	<h1><b>My Family:</b></h1>
                   Let me tell you about my family. I live with my mum, my dad and my  sisters and brothers. We live in Lahore. My mum’s name is Saira. She’s housewife and she speaks Urdu.My dad’s name is Latif. He’s tall and a little fat!. He works in a Private Company.</div>
                    <div id="Achicements">
                    	<h1><b>Achicements:</b></h1>
                    	I have achieved many different goals in life. Some of my achievements are bigger than the others, which has given me greater satisfaction. 
                    	<h3>“Live the Life of Your Dreams
When you start living the life of your dreams, there will always be obstacles, doubters, mistakes and setbacks along the way. But with hard work, perseverance and self-belief there is no limit to what you can achieve.”<br>
                    </div>
                    <div id="Future Goal">
                    	<h1><b>Future Goal:</b></h1>I learned this from my early days in Software engineering. There were 100’s of engineers working on this project, but there was one guy that everyone listened to. His mind didn’t work the same way everyone else’s did, he just dreamed stuff up. The rest of us just calculated what he thought up.

My goal was always to be the one guy. The one who could solve anything, design anything, debug anything in a different way then everyone else. If I thought I would have better ideas by knowing hardware I would learn it. If I thought I needed to understand finance to code it I would learn it. If I felt that learning other coding languages would help me I would learn it.
